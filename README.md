# Robotics-BEST-2017
Code for the Best Robotics Remote (cortex)

Each Class period (4th, 8th, 10th) should be focusing on writing the code for that periods portion of the robot. 
For example, 4th period should be writing code for the launcher, 8th period should be writing code for the Claw,
10th period should focus on driving. 

I would make pull request, and wait to merge them once we know each code is not conflicting. 
Be sure to add notes by adding --> // to make coments about what each line of code does.
